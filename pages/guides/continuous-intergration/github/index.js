      <Heading content='Sensitive Data' noMargin tag='h2' />

      <p>
        It should be obvious that all sensitive company and personal data should not make it's way
        onto DRYKISS repositories.
      </p>

      <p>
        Files may include environment variables; private configuration data or sensitive information
        about the public.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the event that such variables or configuration data is pushed to a GitHub repository
        accidentally, even momentarily, consider it compromised and revoke or change the credentials
        immediately. Do not delete the commit itself!
      </p>

      <p>
        Contact the #security channel in slack immediately and give honest information about the
        incident. Further reading of how to clean up such an incident can be found here,{' '}
        <a href='https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/removing-sensitive-data-from-a-repository'>
          Removing sensitive data from a repository.
        </a>{' '}
        Do not attempt this cleanup let the trained security staff handle this.
